I created a TUS branded lens for snapchat. This lens is made for secondary school students who are considering joining an IT course in TUS. Once the user scans the snapcode it will open the lens for the user. The lens will segment the user and replace the background with a picture of the entrance of the TUS Moylish campus. The user will have a TUS logo below their head. There will also be pictures constantly switching above the userâ€™s head. These pictures have the names of the various IT courses offered at TUS. A hint will appear telling the user to open their mouth to stop the pictures. After this the images will stop switching and it will stop on the image displayed when the user opens their mouth. After this a hint will appear telling the user to tap the screen to restart. If the user taps the screen the images will start constantly switching again.
The reason behind this lens is to help the user select a course. This is a common trend on social media apps such as Snapchat and TikTok. In this trend images will constantly switch and once the user does the required action it will stop on one of the images.
